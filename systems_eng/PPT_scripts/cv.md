Dear Recruiter,

I'm currently pursuing my master's in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon
University after having worked in an AgTech start-up for the past two years. I'm excited that
robotics and autonomy seem to be the natural next step in sowing, maintaining, and
harvesting of crops. I enjoy working with computer-vision and specifically on the edge
devices that dictate compute optimization. The Raven presentation at CMU was wonderful
and I would love to work as a computer vision intern at Raven in the summer of 2023.

The last two years of my career have allowed me to explore field robotics through
TartanSense. Over and above my experience with designing hardware that works in harsh
environments, the end-to-end systems development has given me an intuition of how
software interacts with the physical systems of a robot. For example, to tackle the
unevenness of plant rows, I drove the development of a new hydraulic lane-centering
system(patent pending) within the mechanical team. Later on, I worked in the computer
vision team to integrate depth perception with existing RGB vision to detect stems of plants
and reduce object localisation errors. This knowledge helped me understand the entire loop
of object detection, object tracking, ROS integration, and mechanism actuation. I look forward
to apply these learnings at Raven and make meaningful contributions.

Sincerely
Sushanth Jayanth
