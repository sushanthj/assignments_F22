# Auxilio CoDRP

Really detailed comments, filter out the main ones

## Shivam
- Looks too serious man xD
- Loved the fact that you visited an assited living facility
- Nice definition of goals (especially through the Primary goals)
- Spend little more time on the changes to your requirements


## Abhinav
- Nice cyberphysical, easily to look at
- Could you guys also use a state machine like us? You too have like a navigation, manipulation
  and teleoperation mode (but nonetheless, your slides on the cyberphysical was good)

## Atharva
- The mobility platform trade study seems little unnecessary since you have no choice 
  (Ex. we found that a system level trade study such as AMR vs Conveyor vs Humans was not useful
  because our stakeholder clearly didn't want anything other than an AMR)

## Praveen
- The lack of arrows in your WBS is a little weird, like it works everywhere else, just not here
- Multi-join planning vs senior's work was good
- Nice breakdown of your WBS leading onto your schedule

## Shaolin
- Your Risk likelihood-matrix was barely visible
- Did you guys address the risk of the TourRi's stack being shitty?
