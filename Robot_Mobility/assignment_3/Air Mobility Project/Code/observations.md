# Question 5

## Gain set default

1. At Kp 20, kd 9 (for z) others were (17kp and 6.6kd)
   - rise time = 0.66
   - max percentage overshoot = 0
   - settling time = 0.66
   - steady state value = 0.0999

2. At Kp 21, kd 5, with yaw
   - rise time = 0.71
   - max percentage overshoot = 0
   - settling time = 0.71
   - steady_state_value = 0.099
